# Mini Search

## Description
Build a React web application with a rich UI/UX that allows the user to search across a specific website

## Requirements

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
- [GIPHY](https://giphy.com)
- [Spotify](https://spotify.com)
2. Thoughtful UI/UX design

## Bonus Points
- Extend search to multiple sites
- Cloud hosted and accessible for testing and evaluation


## Submission
- All code must be pushed to the repo

## Getting Started
The **Mini Search** app is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the the app by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
